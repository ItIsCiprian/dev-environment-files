Neovim Setup
Important: This is my latest config with lazy.nvim. It is similar, but not the same as my original packer setup.

ðŸ“¹ lazy.nvim Neovim in this repro in .config/nvim

If you clone the repo into your machine and use the config by copying .config/nvim to your home folder, wait for the plugins, language servers and parsers to install with lazy.nvim, Mason and nvim-treesitter. If you are opening a lua file or another file I have language servers configured for, like html, css or javascript/typescript, you might also get an error saying that the server failed to start. This is because Mason hasn't installed it yet. Press enter to continue, Mason will automatically install it.
