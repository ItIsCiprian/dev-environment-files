# How To Setup And Use The Yabai Tiling Window Manager On Mac
**Published: February 11, 2023**

You can find my current yabai config and the rest of my dotfiles here: [dotfiles](https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles)

## Configure MacOS Specific Settings
- Open **Several Desktops (~7)** on Your Machine
- Go To **Keyboard Settings > Shortcuts > Mission Control**
  - Expand Mission Control and Turn On Shortcuts for **Switching Spaces 1-7** with `Ctrl + # Of Space`
- Go to **System Settings > Accessibility > Display**
  - Turn On **Reduce Motion**
- Go To **System Settings > Desktop & Dock > Mission Control**
  - Turn off **Automatically Rearrange Spaces Based On Most Recent Use**
  - Personally, I only keep **Displays Have Separate Spaces** turned on here, and that’s what I’d recommend

## Open a Terminal Window
- Open a terminal window on your Mac. Could be the default terminal or something else like iTerm2, which is what I’m currently using.

## Install Homebrew
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
- If necessary, when prompted, enter your password here and press enter. If you haven’t installed the XCode Command Line Tools, when prompted, press enter and Homebrew will install this as well.

## Add To Path (Only Apple Silicon Macbooks)
- After installing, add it to the path. This step shouldn’t be necessary on Intel Macs.
```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

## Install Yabai
```bash
brew install koekeishiya/formulae/yabai
```

## Install Skhd
```bash
brew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd
```

## Create Yabai Config File in Home Directory
- Move to home folder and create directory for yabai config file (config will live in `.config/yabai/yabairc`):
```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p .config/yabai
cd .config/yabai
touch yabairc
```

## Add Configuration Options to File
- Open `yabairc` with your preferred editor and add your configuration. All of the options I’ve configured below will work without disabling SIP (System Integrity Protection).

### Example Configurations
- Set default layout to `bsp` (Binary Space Partitioning).
- Configure window padding and gaps.
- Set mouse actions for focusing and moving windows.
- Disable specific apps from being managed with yabai, e.g., System Settings, Calculator.

## Start Yabai and Skhd
- Use `brew services` to start and manage yabai and skhd services. Allow any prompts for accessibility permissions.

## Create Skhd Config File in Home Directory
- Similar to yabai config, set up your skhd config in `.config/skhd/skhdrc` and define your keyboard shortcuts.

## That’s It, You’re Done!
- Enjoy your new tiling window management setup on Mac with yabai and skhd!
